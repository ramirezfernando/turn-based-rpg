## How to Play

### Characters

| Fire Knight ðŸ”¥ | Water Priestess ðŸŒŠ | Ground Monk ðŸª¨ |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| ![Fire Knight](assets/characters/fire_knight/fire_knight.png) | ![Water Priestess](assets/characters/water_priestess/water_priestess.png) | ![Ground Monk](assets/characters/ground_monk/ground_monk.png) |

- **Fire Knight:** High damage, high energy cost, aggressive play.
- **Ground Monk:** Balanced stats, adaptable.
- **Water Priestess:** Lower damage, efficient energy usage, excels at sustained combat.

### Gameplay

- Choose your character and battle against an AI enemy.
- Each turn, select an action: Attack, Check Stats, Save, or Run.
- Attacks consume energy and deal damage; each character has four attack types.
- The battle ends when either character's health or energy reaches zero.
